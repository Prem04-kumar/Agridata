# Agridata
EDA AND POWERBI VISUALS OF AGRIDATA
First, I performed data imputation to handle missing values.
Then, I did (EDA) to understand the data set.
After that, I wrote SQL queries to analyze the data.
Finally, I created visuals in Power BI using the SQL queries to get clearer insights from the dataset.
